next feature:

bug: -ve sign does not show whenever some money has to be deducted from someone in balances screen
improvement: remove the hamburger reorder functionality completely, but make sure the arrow buttons are now avbl for all screen sizes.

always add this to the coplilot_instructions first and then implement code changes
