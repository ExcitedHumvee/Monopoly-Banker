next feature:
    if the input transcation is not valid, u get this generic error: "No valid instructions parsed from input."
    the errors should be more useful and specific
    there should be an info button just to the right of reset (use the info icon) and then just like the Transaction History pop up box there should be a Help Box on how to use this app

always add this to the coplilot_instructions first and then implement code changes
