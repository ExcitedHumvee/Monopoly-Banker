Monopoly Banker: Application Requirements Document
1.0 Overview

The Monopoly Banker is a static web application designed to simplify the role of the banker in a game of Monopoly. The application's sole purpose is to track player bank balances and display them accurately after every transaction. It will be a simple, single-page application hosted on GitHub Pages.
2.0 Core Functionality

The application consists of two main phases: Game Setup and Transaction Processing.

    Game Setup: At the beginning of a session, the user must define the players, their unique shortcodes, and their starting bank balances.

    Transaction Processing: Once the game starts, the user can input financial transactions. The application will parse these inputs, update the player balances accordingly, and display the results.

    Game Reset: The user must have the ability to reset the game at any point, clearing all balances and returning to the initial setup screen.

3.0 Player and Balance Management
3.1 Player Initialization

    The application should allow the user to specify a list of players.

    For each player, the user must define:

        Full Name: A descriptive name for the player (e.g., "Giselle").

        Shortcode: A unique, single-character, case-insensitive identifier (e.g., "g").

        Initial Balance: The starting amount of money for the player.

    A default initial balance of $1500 should be pre-filled for each player, though this value must be user-editable.

    The application should be pre-configured with the following default players, shortcodes, and balances:

        Giselle → g ($1500)

        Mia → m ($1500)

        Zian → z ($1500)

        Tyrone → t ($1500)

        Stany → s ($1500)

4.0 Transaction Rules
4.1 Transaction Input Format

    The user will input transactions as a single line of text.

    A transaction consists of one or more instructions separated by spaces.

    Each instruction is a pair of a player's shortcode and a numerical amount.

    The order of the shortcode and amount does not matter. The following formats are all valid:

        <shortcode> <amount> (e.g., g 100)

        <amount> <shortcode> (e.g., 100 g)

    Multiple instructions can be combined in a single input line (e.g., z 100 g -200).

    A positive amount signifies money being added to the player's balance.

    A negative amount signifies money being subtracted from the player's balance.

4.2 Transaction Processing Logic

    The application must parse the transaction input sequentially.

    A number is always associated with the nearest valid player shortcode, whether it appears immediately before or after it.

    All valid instructions within a single input line must be processed and applied to the players' balances simultaneously for that turn.

    Any numbers not paired with a valid shortcode must be ignored.

    Any shortcodes not paired with a number must be ignored.

    Balance changes are persistent and carry over to the next transaction until the game is reset.

5.0 Output and Display Rules

    After every valid transaction, the application must display the current status of all player balances.

    The display order of players must always be consistent: Giselle, Mia, Zian, Tyrone, Stany.

    For each player, the display must show their current total balance.

    If a player's balance was modified in the most recent transaction, the display must also show the amount of that change in parentheses next to their total balance.

        The change should be prefixed with a + for positive amounts and a - for negative amounts (e.g., (+$100) or (-$200)).

    If a player's balance was not affected in the most recent transaction, only their total balance should be displayed, without any parenthetical change amount.

6.0 Error Handling

    The application must be robust against malformed input.

    If two numbers appear consecutively, only the one directly adjacent to a valid shortcode should be processed. The other should be ignored.

    If the application cannot parse any valid instruction from the user's input, it must display an appropriate error message to the user.
Development Notes

- Next feature: In the Game Setup page, provide an easy way to rearrange players. Add a small "hamburger" drag-handle (☰) on each player row so the user can drag to reorder players.

- Process: Always add the feature request or instruction to `copilot_instructions` first, then implement the corresponding code changes in the repository.

- Next feature: Fix mobile UI issues. On small screens the initial player balance inputs in Game Setup overflow to the right, and the Reset button on the Transactions screen can go off-screen. Make the layout responsive so inputs wrap or shrink appropriately and controls remain visible on mobile devices.

- Next feature: Add a "History" button on the Transactions page that shows a list of past transaction lines and their parsed effects, and a "Go Back" button to undo the last applied transaction or return to the previous screen. As always, add this note to `copilot_instructions` first, then implement the UI and logic.

- Next feature: Hamburger reorder not working on mobile. Add small touch-friendly up/down move buttons visible on narrow screens and ensure the drag handle is touch-friendly. Add this to `copilot_instructions` first, then implement.

- Next feature: Prevent mobile zoom on the transaction input. On some mobile browsers (notably iOS Safari) tapping inputs with small font-sizes causes the browser to zoom in. To avoid this, ensure the transaction input and other touch inputs use a font-size of at least 16px or use an appropriate viewport setting. Add this instruction to `copilot_instructions` first, then implement changes.

- Next feature: Display balances above the "Enter transaction:" input on the Transactions page instead of below it. Add this to `copilot_instructions` first, then reorder the UI so the balances list is shown before the transaction controls.

- Next feature: In the Game Setup page, show all three text boxes (name, shortcode, balance) on a single row. The three inputs should be responsive and shrink proportionally on smaller screens so they remain visible without wrapping. Add this note to `copilot_instructions` first, then implement the UI/CSS changes.

- Next feature: In the Game Setup page, add an "X" delete button on each player row to allow removing a player. Also add validations in the setup (for example: no repeating names). As always, add this instruction to `copilot_instructions` first, then implement the code changes.

- Next feature: In the Game Setup page, add a button to "Add Player" that appends a new empty player row to the setup list. Add this instruction to `copilot_instructions` first, then implement the UI and handler to add rows.

- Bug report: When clicking Add Player, existing players' shortcodes reset to 'a', 'b', 'c', etc., and newly created players don't appear correctly after starting the game. Add this report to `copilot_instructions` and investigate fixes (preserve existing player codes, avoid auto-overwriting, and ensure renderBalances shows extras).

- Next feature: When pressing Reset, do not revert to DEFAULT_PLAYERS; instead return to the Game Setup page populated with the current players and their current details (names, codes, balances). Add this instruction to `copilot_instructions` first, then implement the code changes.

- Bug/Improvement: Negative sign not showing when balances are decreased; remove the hamburger (drag-handle) reorder functionality entirely and make the arrow up/down buttons available at all screen sizes. Add this note to `copilot_instructions` first, then implement the UI/CSS/JS changes.

- Next feature: Reduce the main container width to approximately half of its current width so the UI appears narrower. Add this instruction to `copilot_instructions` first, then update styles.

 - Next feature: in the transactions screen: i see "Transactions" and "Balances". Get rid of "Balances" and rename "Transactions" to "Balances"

 always add this to the coplilot_instructions first and then implement code changes

next feature:

Monopoly Banker should be centered
after a transaction, if someones balance as changed: the name and amount should be in bold, and balance-change should be green or red if it increases or decreases

always add this to the coplilot_instructions first and then implement code changes
